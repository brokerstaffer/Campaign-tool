/*
 * The cron cadence, as data.
 *
 * Cadence follows how fast each source actually changes, not how cheap it is:
 *
 *   replies       10 min  — the only metric anyone watches for during a day
 *   entities      30 min  — new campaigns and the client mapping
 *   daily series   1 h    — one call per campaign returns the WHOLE window, so
 *                           a 7-day sweep costs the same as a 1-day one
 *   reply timing   1 h    — a draining work queue, capped at 500 replies/run
 *   day stats      3 h    — 95 campaigns x 3 days = ~285 calls; the expensive one
 *
 * The nightly sweeps are drift repair: EmailBison revises recent days after the
 * fact (late bounces, delayed opens, `interested` flipped by hand), so a wide
 * re-fetch each night is what keeps last month's numbers from slowly diverging
 * from the source. They are staggered an hour apart so they never contend for
 * the same rate-limit budget.
 *
 * All times are UTC. 06:00–09:00 UTC is 02:00–05:00 in the workspace's
 * America/New_York timezone, i.e. the quietest sending window.
