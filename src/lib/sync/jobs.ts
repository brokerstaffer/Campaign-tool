 * no per-lead call.
 *
 * SHARDED PER CAMPAIGN, four at a time. A cursor is inherently serial, so one
 * global chain would take about an hour against a 6.7 req/s ceiling; four chains
 * saturate that ceiling and finish in about forty. Sharding is also the only
 * version with a resume point — one cursor per campaign, persisted after every
 * page, so a killed run loses one page rather than 1,239.
 *
 * RAW SENDS, NOT A RUNNING TOTAL. opens/clicks accrue for days after sent_at, so
