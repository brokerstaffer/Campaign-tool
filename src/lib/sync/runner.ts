/*
 * Cron bookkeeping: locking, run history, and a circuit breaker.
 *
 * Three properties every job gets for free:
 *
 *  1. NO OVERLAP. `sync_state.running_since` is a lock. A job already running
 *     is skipped rather than run twice — two concurrent day-stat syncs would
 *     double the EmailBison call volume for identical results.
 *
 *  2. CRASH RECOVERY. A lock older than the stale threshold is stolen. Without
 *     that, one crashed run would wedge the job permanently, and the failure
 *     mode ("data silently stopped updating") is the hardest kind to notice.
 *
 *  3. CIRCUIT BREAKER. After MAX_FAILURES consecutive failures the job stops
 *     attempting. If EmailBison is down or the key is revoked, hammering it
 *     every 10 minutes helps nobody; `last_error` is left in place to explain.
 */

/*
 * How long a lock is honoured before it's assumed to belong to a dead process.
 *
 * Every redeploy kills whatever was mid-sweep, so this is not an edge case —
 * it happens on every deploy, and it is the only thing standing between a
 * killed run and a job that never runs again.
 *
 * Ten minutes is calibrated against what these jobs actually take. Measured in
 * production: entities 9s, steps 13s, daily-series 14s (deep 31s), replies 16s
 * (deep 60s), day-stats 26s (deep 102s), reply-timing 122-212s. The slowest is
 * under four minutes, so ten is a wide margin.
 *
 * Getting it too short costs a duplicate run — extra EmailBison calls, and
 * nothing else, because every job is idempotent. Getting it too long means a
 * dead job stays dead: at the old 30 minutes, a deploy landing mid-sweep cost
 * the 10-minute reply sync three consecutive ticks.
 *
 * Releasing locks on SIGTERM would be better than any timeout, but Next
 * installs its own signal handler that calls process.exit(0), and its
 * cleanup-listener hook is dev-only — an async release can't reliably finish.
