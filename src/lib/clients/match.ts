/*
 * Campaign name → client matcher.
 *
 * All clients share one EmailBison workspace and are identified by their name
 * appearing somewhere in the campaign name. The dominant pattern is
 * `<Client>[ N] + <Persona> + <Segment>`, but it is not reliable enough to
 * parse — hence matching rather than splitting.
 *
 * Hazards this is built against, all observed in the live workspace:
 *
 *   "Copy of LIV Indy Realty 4 + Nicole + MIBOR"
 *       the client name is NOT always a prefix.
 *   "Kelly + Co + Nicole + BRIGHT"
 *       a client name can contain the `+` separator, so splitting on `+` is wrong.
 *   "Rise Real Estate Antelope" vs "Rise Real Estate Tujunga"
 *       separate clients sharing a 3-token prefix.
 *   "SERHANT. PA" vs "SERHANT. PA 15M+"
 *       one client name is a strict prefix of another.
 *   "The RE Home Group of Douglas Realty" vs "Douglas Elliman LA"
 *       share the token "douglas" but are unrelated.
 *   "Jeff Cook Real Estate LPT Realty  2"
 *       double spaces.
 *   "SERHANT. PA", "Properties & Estates", "RE/MAX Pacific"
 *       punctuation that must normalise away.
 *
 * Two rules do the real work:
 *   1. Match whole TOKEN RUNS, never raw substrings. This is what keeps a client
 *      named "Rise" out of "Sunrise Realty" — without it the whole scheme
 *      silently mis-attributes.
 *   2. Longest match wins, measured in tokens. This is what resolves every
 *      nested-name case above. Equal-length ties are flagged ambiguous and left
 *      unassigned rather than guessed, because a silent mis-attribution is worse
 *      than a visible gap: nobody goes looking for it.
