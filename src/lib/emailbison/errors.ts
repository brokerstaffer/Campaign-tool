/*
 * The API error type lives here rather than in client.ts for two reasons: it
 * breaks the cycle that would otherwise exist (client imports assertApplied,
 * errors imports the class), and it keeps this module importable by a test
 * without dragging in fetch.
 *
 * Written with explicit fields rather than TypeScript parameter properties.
 * Parameter properties are the one common TS feature Node's strip-only mode
 * cannot handle — it is a transform, not an erasure — and this repo runs its
 * tests directly against .ts with no build step. The old form made every module
 * in this directory untestable.

 * Turning an EmailBison failure into the sentence a human should read.
 *
 * Spec §9.5: "If a change can't be applied on the sending platform, the
 * dashboard says so with the ACTUAL REASON." A message of "EmailBison 422
 * Unprocessable Content" satisfies the letter of that and none of its purpose —
 * the operator still has no idea what to change.
 *
 * The shape that matters, observed on PATCH /api/campaigns/{id}/update:
 *
 *   {"data": {"success": false,
 *             "message": "The max emails per day field must be greater than or
 *                         equal to max new leads per day.",
 *             "errors": {"max_emails_per_day": ["..."]}}}
 *
 * Note the nesting under `data`. EmailBison wraps errors the same way it wraps
 * resources, so anything that only reads the top level finds nothing and falls
 * back to the status line.
