 * KPI band and every filter — a route change would remount the band and flash
 * it, which is exactly the shimmer the whole design is trying to avoid.
 *
 * All four sub-views from the spec are live. Replies was the last, and it is
 * the only one that needs lead attributes rather than campaign aggregates.
