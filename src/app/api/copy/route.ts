 * Copy performance (spec §6.1), grouped by ONE OR MORE dimensions.
 *
 * The screenshot's control is `Dimension: [picker] [chip ✕] [+ Add Dimension]`,
 * so the grouping is a SET, not a single choice, and the number of value
 * combinations is not knowable in SQL ahead of time. This route therefore asks
 * the database for per-step rows with their tags attached and forms the
 * combinations here.
 *
 * That is the app's one exemption from "aggregate in SQL", and it is bounded on
 * purpose: the row count is the number of sequence steps with volume in range
 * (233 today) and grows with campaigns, not with sending. The per-day stats
 * behind every row are still summed in SQL, so the PostgREST 1000-row cap this
 * rule exists to dodge is not reachable by data growth.
