/*
 * The Attribution tab (spec §7).
 *
 * Four questions in one payload, because they are read together and a partial
 * answer to any of them is misleading on its own:
 *
 *   coverage  — how much of the feed is credited to a campaign at all. This
 *               number gates the others; 44% attributed and 100% attributed
 *               support completely different conclusions from the same table.
 *   totals    — every event type in the range, whether or not it was attributed.
 *   measures  — "how many emails it takes to earn one introduction" (§7).
 *   campaigns — which campaigns produce RESULTS, not just activity.
 *
 * `sent` for the conversion measures comes from the same eb_daily_series the KPI
 * band's Sent tile reads, so "Email to Introduction" and "Sent" can never
 * disagree about the numerator.
